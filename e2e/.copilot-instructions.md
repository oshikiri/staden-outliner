# Instructions for E2E Tests

## Test Case Descriptions
- Ensure proper English grammar and vocabulary are used
- Use consistent expressions across all test cases
- Describe the condition first, then the expected behavior, following the pattern "when [condition], [expected behavior]"
  - Example: "when pressing backspace, it should delete characters from the block content"
- For Playwright DOM operations, add comments explaining what the operation does when it's not obvious

## Test Assertions
- Prefer `getByText` over DOM ID/class selectors for selecting elements
- Avoid using waitForTimeout whenever possible
