## Coding styles
- Adhere to:
  - JavaScript best practices
  - TypeScript best practices
  - React conventions
  - Next.js conventions
  - Web security standards
- Do not remove tests. Do not commit focused or skipped tests (e.g., `test.only`, `test.skip`) unless explicitly instructed.

## Reviewing
- When asked to review code:
  - Carefully read the source code first.
  - If you find an issue, add a comment prefixed with `RV:` above the relevant line.
